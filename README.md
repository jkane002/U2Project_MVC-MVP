# U2Project_MVC-MVP
Unit 2 Project MVC/MVP

**Project Name:** Login Screen

**Project Description:** For this project, we expand more on MVC and implement an application of it - the MVP design pattern. Remember that MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. Now MVP stands for Model, View, and Presenter. We discuss the differences in the background section below. This simple login screen application explicitly highlights the MVP pattern. This can also be used in future applications and projects enhancing user experience and mimicking daily applications on the App store.
